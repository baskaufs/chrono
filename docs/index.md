# Chronometric Age Extension

{:.alert .alert-info}
This document forms part of a proposal by the [Chronometric Age Extension Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/esp/chrono/) to extend Darwin Core with vocabulary for chronometric ages. It is not yet ratified and may change as a result of recommendations received during the course of Open Public Commentary.

The Chronometric Age extension is a standard vocabulary maintained by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Interest Group](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/#maintenance-group). It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about chronometric ages and the techniques used to determine them.** by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions.

## Getting started

- [Quick Reference Guide](terms/)
- Usage guide: how to use the Chronometric Age Extension (forthcoming)
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tdwg/chrono): where the Chronometric Age Extensions is maintained
- [Normative term list](list/): the document containing the full history of normative Darwin Core term definitions
- [Utility files](https://github.com/tdwg/chrono/tree/master/dist): CSV files of vertical and horizontal term lists plus the Darwin Core Extension schema
